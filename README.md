Racing Game 3D: The Speed Cage

We are two guys currently studying VideoGame Development and Design at CITM (Centre de la Imatge i la Tecnologia Multimedia), and we developed a 3D racing game.

Controls:

Car movement with the arrow keys:
⇦:left ⇧:forward ⇩: brake/backward ⇨:right

The game has 3 checkpoints, after you reached any of them press "K" to return to the last checkpoint.

F1 for debug mode.
F2 to unlock the camera.

Goal of the game:

Do 3 laps in the lowest time possible.

You can restart the game (completely) everytime the laps are completed by pressing "J"

Group members (programmers):

Eric Abad & Guillem Dominguez

If you encounter a bug, you can go to our repository and create an issue. It will be appreciated :)
